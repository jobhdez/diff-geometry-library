Suppose you have a set X.

Then a topology T on X is a collection of subsets of X called open subsets
that satisfy:

(1) X and the empty set are open.
(2) The union of open subsets is open.
(3) The intersection of finite open subsets is open.

Note: Here `open` means that if a subset U is open in X then U is in the
topology of X.

A Topological Manifold is a topological space with a given
structure that encodes the meaning that a manifold looks locally like
R^n.

Suppose M is a topological space.

Then M consists of the following structure that makes it behave like
Euclidian space R^n.

(1) M is a Hausdorff space.
(2) M is second countable
(3) M is locally euclidian of dimension n.

A Smooth Manifold is a Toplogical Manifold with a given structure that allow us
to make sense of derivatives on real value functions, curve between manifolds.

Let U and V be open subsets of a manifold M.

Then f: U -> V is smooth if each component function has continuous partial derivatives of
all order.

A chart on a Topological Manifold M is a pair (U, p') consisting of an
open subset U of M and a homeomorphism p: U -> U' where U' is defined
as p(U') being a subset of R^n.

Here a homeomorphism means that p: U -> U' and p^-1: U'-> U are both continuous.

Given a chart on M, each point p in M is in the coordinate domain.

Given a chart, the local map and set of functions (x1,x2,..xn)
of the map map(p') = (x1(p), x2(p), ..xn(p))
