- need a calculus system powerful enough to
   - calculate  christoffel symbols
   - riemann curvature tensor given christoffel symbols
   - ricci tensor from riemann curvature tensor
   - scalar curvature
   - einstein tensor: ric-g*scalarCurvature/2
      - a zero matrix means no matter or non gravitation fields are present
      - this related to black holes
   - it would be nice if i can calculate the solution that predicts the expansion of the universe.
     evidence that the universe had a beginning which may have some philosophical implication
     
- also compute the curvature of spheres. you do this with riemann tensor
- you need to model differential geometry right. your code needs to make conceptual sense,
  not just work.
